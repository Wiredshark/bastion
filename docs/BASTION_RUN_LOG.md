# Project Bastion — batch-builder run log (append-only)

Format per entry: block · start SHA · timestamp · result (PASS/FAIL) · end SHA · summary.
`bastion/main` only advances by fully-tested, tagged blocks. Each block's work
lives on `bastion/block-<N>` for fine-grained rollback.

## Pre-log history (blocks merged before tagging discipline began)

- **B0** — baseline + headless harness. Merged (pre-log). Determinism OK at
  aggregate level; see `BASELINE.md`, `docs/BASTION_B0_FINDINGS.md`,
  `docs/BASTION_HARNESS.md`.
- **B1** — ortho overseer camera + Z-slice. Merged (pre-log). See
  `docs/BASTION_B1_FINDINGS.md`, `docs/BASTION_CAMERA.md`.
- **B1.5** — input contexts + B&W2 camera feel + spectate streaming. Merged
  (pre-log, `40d1079`). See `docs/BASTION_B1_5_FINDINGS.md`.
- **B1.6** — 4-mode occlusion framework + relight + 4 rounds of in-game QA.
  Merged (pre-log, `cc4b277..6d5e38b`). Retro-tagged `bastion-block-B1.6` at
  `6d5e38b`. See `docs/BASTION_B1_6_FINDINGS.md`, `docs/BASTION_VIEWMODES.md`.
- **B1.7** — LoD/frustum fix (black-wedge + early-LoD). Landed *inside* the
  B1.6 QA rounds rather than as a separate block: the black wedge = ortho
  near-plane clip, fixed by `OVERSEER_BEHIND` (commit `f126d66`); the early-LoD
  collapse = terrain-anchor re-centering churn, fixed by anchor hysteresis
  (commit `6d5e38b`). Retro-tagged `bastion-block-B1.7` at `6d5e38b`.

## Session 2026-07-08 (batch runner)

- Architect inputs committed on main: design doc v2.1, `readme/agency-bible.md`,
  `readme/df-feature-gap-ledger.md` (`f456b08`).
- NOTE: the queue marks B2a/B3/B4/B2b as [PROMPTED], but no
  `B*-claude-code-builder-prompt.md` files exist in the tree — building those
  blocks from their design-doc entries (authoritative on conflict anyway).

### B2a — Overseer interaction surface

- Start SHA: `f456b08` · branch `bastion/block-B2a` · started 2026-07-08.
