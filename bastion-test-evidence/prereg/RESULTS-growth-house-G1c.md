# RESULTS — the colonists build the worldgen house (G1c): the request fires, the site resolves, and the index is never unshared

The G1b pre-registration named this branch: "if IndexShared fires every
tick on a live server, the design's premise (quiet ticks exist) is
false." It is false, and for a reason the unit tests could not see:
the Server struct keeps its own `IndexOwned` (server/src/lib.rs:283)
and inserts a CLONE into the ECS (line 1034), so the index Arc has two
permanent owners and `Arc::get_mut` can never succeed. The chunk
generator's transient clones were the assumed sharer; the struct field
is the real one.

## Disposition

G1c's wiring PASSED its own instruments up to the seam (site resolved,
request raised, refusal named with its count) and cannot proceed past
it. Not a colony defect: an ownership fact of the vanilla server. Fix
in flight (an isolated builder): the ECS resource becomes the sole
owner and the server's dozen uses fetch it, with a boot witness that
prints the strong count (must read 1). Until then no worldgen house
can be laid out on a live server; the G1c boot on b1 is kept for its
other reads. The premise is re-tested by the same boot the moment the
fix lands.
